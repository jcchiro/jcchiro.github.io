description: Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) have been around for over 2,500 years. It is one of the oldest and longest-standing health care systems in the world.<br><br>The goal of acupuncture is to promote and restore the balance of energy, or qi (pronounced “chee”), which flows throughout the body. When healthy, an abundant supply of qi, or energy, is found throughout meridians (channels or pathways) in the body. If there is a blockage of qi, or if there is not enough qi, the body’s balance is lost, leading to disease or illness. This can occur due to stress, poor diet, overexertion, disease pathogens, injury, or exposure to environmental elements.<br><br>The insertion of hair-thin needles at specific locations on the body helps to clear any blockages of qi, boosts qi, and promotes the smooth and normal flow of qi through the body’s meridians. Traditionally acupuncture has been used to prevent and treat disease, as well as to improve general health.<br><br>Check out our different TCM treatment modalities here.
