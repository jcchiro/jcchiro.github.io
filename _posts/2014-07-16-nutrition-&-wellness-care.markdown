description: “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.”<br> Our doctors believe in teaching you how to fish when it comes to your health. We teach our patients to be actively involved when it comes to their health. From learning about better choices to make a the grocery store, to proper computer screen positioning to prevent neck pain, we believe that what you do at home or at work is just as important as what we do in the office.<br><br>Nutrition and what you eat on a daily basis plays a huge role in in your health. Your nutrition can increase your risk of getting certain diseases or worsen a condition that you already have. It affects how fast (or slow) your recovery is after getting injured. Many health conditions are caused by chronic inflammation in the body. Find out if what you eat is causing inflammation in your body, and ask your doctor how you can decrease inflammation at home.
