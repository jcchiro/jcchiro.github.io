                 Dr. Dominique Bariso is both a chiropractor and a licensed acupuncturist. She uses a “whole-body” approach when treating her patients, combining both eastern and western medicine. Dr. Dominique is a firm believer in finding and treating the root cause of the health problem, instead of just treating the symptoms. Her goals are to get you out of pain, keep you out of pain, and get you healthy.
