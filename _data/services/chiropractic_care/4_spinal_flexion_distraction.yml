modal-id: 4
description: "Flexion distraction is a technique used to treat multiple conditions of the lumbar spine (lower back). The goal is to increase spinal motion, decrease symptoms from disc bulges or herniations, and take pressure off of nerves that may be injured. It is a gentle, non-force technique that requires a special table that slowly and repetitively distracts and flexes the spine. It is commonly used to treat: low back pain, disc injuries, arthritis, lower back stiffness, SI syndrome, spinal stenosis, leg pain/sciatica, failed back surgical syndrome."
