description: Moxibustion is a technique that involves burning mugwort, also known as <i>artemisia vulgaris</i>, to promote healing. In Chinese medicine, moxibustion is used to expel cold and warm the meridians, stimulate the smooth flow of qi and blood, and maintain general health. Similar to lighting a candle or incense, moxibustion produces some smoke and a pungent odor.
